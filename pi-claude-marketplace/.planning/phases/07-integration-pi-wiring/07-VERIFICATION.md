# Phase 07 Verification: Integration & Pi Wiring

## Verdict

**PASSED** - Phase 07 achieves its integration goal. All six plans are complete, all summaries report `Self-Check: PASSED`, the post-review blocker fixes are committed, and the full phase gate is green.

## Goal Coverage

| Success Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| Pi API boundary and peer floor established | Passed | `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/platform/pi-api.ts`; direct peer imports are guarded by ESLint; `package.json` pins `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent >=0.73.1`. |
| Real Pi entrypoint wires command, tools, completions, and resources discovery | Passed | `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/index.ts` registers `/claude:plugin`, read-only marketplace tools, `session_start`, and `resources_discover`; `tests/shared/index-smoke.test.ts` covers event-cwd project discovery. |
| Manifest reads route through the NFR-8 seam | Passed | `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/domain/manifest.ts::loadMarketplaceManifest`; `tests/architecture/manifest-read-seam.test.ts` enforces the seam. |
| Cross-process state locking protects mutating state operations | Passed | `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/transaction/with-state-guard.ts` takes per-scope `.state-lock`; `tests/integration/concurrent-install.test.ts` verifies concurrent install behavior. |
| E2E/CI validation and traceability are complete | Passed | `tests/e2e/*`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml`, `07-VALIDATION.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. |

## Review Follow-Up

Code review initially found 2 blockers and 3 warnings. Commit `6a7e15a` resolved the blockers and two lock robustness warnings:

- `resources_discover` now uses the Pi event `cwd` for project-scope discovery.
- `setMarketplaceAutoupdate` now only suppresses `MarketplaceNotFoundError` for cross-scope single-name lookup; lock/IO failures surface as errors.
- `withStateGuard` no longer masks primary mutate/save failures with lock release failures and only maps actual `ELOCKED` failures to `StateLockHeldError`.

One residual warning remains in `07-REVIEW.md`: the real Pi runtime smoke could be stronger than `--help` output matching. It is non-blocking because the phase also has direct ExtensionAPI smoke coverage and full e2e command/resource tests.

## Automated Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| Targeted review-fix tests | Passed: index smoke, autoupdate, state guard |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed |
| `npm run lint` | Passed |
| `npm run format:check` | Passed |
| `npm test` | Passed: 813 tests, 0 failures |
| `npm run check && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e && npm pack --dry-run` | Passed |
| Schema drift | Passed: `drift_detected=false` |
| Codebase drift | Skipped: `no-structure-md` |

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| NFR-2 | Verified | `resources_discover` wiring, e2e reload discovery, and Pi runtime smoke. |
| NFR-3 | Verified | Cross-process locking and concurrent install integration tests. |
| NFR-8 | Verified | Manifest read seam and architecture gate. |
| NFR-11 | Verified | Pi API peer floor, wrapper, package dry-run, and CI/e2e gates. |

## Risks

- Runtime smoke coverage can be improved in a future hardening pass if Pi exposes a stronger noninteractive extension command/event assertion surface.
- `AGENTS.md` remains untracked and was intentionally not committed because it is a harness-generated workspace artifact.

## Conclusion

Phase 07 is complete and ready to mark as passed in the roadmap/state tracking files.
