# Phase 5: Plugin Orchestrators Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** A user can `install`, `uninstall`, and `update` plugins with 4-phase atomic staging (skills/prompts → agents → MCP → state commit), 3-phase atomic update (prepare → state-guard swap → physical replace), phase-ordered rollback with `(rollback partial: …)` aggregation, top-level `list` filters, and Gap 3 component-path supplement-not-replace correction.
**Verified:** 2026-05-11T04:40:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #   | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1   | `install` consults cached manifest only (no network), stages skills/prompts → agents → MCP in order, commits state last, rolls back earlier phases on failure with `(rollback partial: …)` aggregation; `PathContainmentError` NEVER folded into rollback-partial line | ✓ VERIFIED | `orchestrators/plugin/install.ts`: 5-phase literal `Phase<InstallCtx>[]` array `[skillsPhase, commandsPhase, agentsPhase, mcpPhase, statePhase]` at line 534; `runPhases` called at line 542; `formatRollbackError` called at line 549 -- which has the `PathContainmentError` bypass from `transaction/rollback.ts:42-44`. No `gitOps`/`DEFAULT_GIT_OPS` import (confirmed by `no-orchestrator-network.test.ts` architectural gate). 626/626 tests pass. |
| 2   | Install conflict guards run BEFORE any disk write: cross-plugin name conflicts (skill, prompt, agent) block install with one message listing every conflicting name; cross-marketplace agent ownership refuses to overwrite; `dependencies` declarations install with a manual-install warning | ✓ VERIFIED | `assertNoCrossPluginConflicts` (from `orchestrators/plugin/shared.ts`) called at install.ts line 308 -- BEFORE any bridge prepare. `CrossPluginConflictError` lists conflicts alphabetically by kind (skills, commands, agents). `tests/orchestrators/plugin/shared.test.ts` covers all 5 cases. |
| 3   | `update` runs `syncCloneOnce` once per marketplace, computes resolved version, partitions plugins into `updated`/`unchanged`/`skipped`/`failed`, executes 3-phase atomic swap (prepare → state-guard swap → physical replace), aggregates phase-3a failures before phase-3b, and emits a recovery hint pointing at uninstall+install on phase-3 failure | ✓ VERIFIED | `update.ts`: hand-rolled 3-phase swap (no `runPhases`); `syncCloneOnce` memoizes per `${scope}/${mpName}` key; `RECOVERY_PLUGIN_REINSTALL_PREFIX` composed at line 608 as `` `${RECOVERY_PLUGIN_REINSTALL_PREFIX} "${plugin}".` ``; `PluginUpdatePhase3Error` wraps aggregated phase-3a failures; `updateSinglePlugin: PluginUpdateFn` exported at line 244. |
| 4   | `uninstall` orders correctly (skills/prompts → agents → MCP → state commit → per-plugin data dir), survives concurrent uninstall via silent converge, refuses loudly when foreign content found at agent target, emits `Run /reload to drop "<plugin>"` only when at least one resource was removed | ✓ VERIFIED | `uninstall.ts`: reuses `cascadeUnstagePlugin` from `orchestrators/marketplace/shared.ts` (D-09 reuse); `withStateGuard` wraps cascade + state delete; `alreadyGone` sentinel implements PU-5 literal silence; `droppedAny` guards PU-8 reload hint. PU-7 re-throws `outcome.cause` on `!outcome.ok`. |
| 5   | Top-level `list` (no flags) shows every bucket grouped by scope; each entry shows icon (●/○/⊘), name, optional `(<version>)`, status marker, description truncated at column 66; `upgradable` flag is set iff manifest version differs (string compare); manifest load failure shows `[warning] could not load manifest: <reason>` and STILL renders installed plugins | ✓ VERIFIED | `orchestrators/plugin/list.ts`: read-only (no `withStateGuard`, no git imports); `renderPluginList` called with structured `PluginListPayload` + `warnings[]`; PL-5 string compare at list.ts; `presentation/plugin-list.ts`: `truncateColumn66` private function, `ICON_INSTALLED`/`ICON_AVAILABLE`/`ICON_UNINSTALLABLE` constants, `renderPluginList` exported. `no-orchestrator-network.test.ts` architectural gate enforced. |
| 6   | Custom component-path arrays SUPPLEMENT defaults rather than replace them (Gap 3 / COMP-01 fix vs. V1 behavior), documented in CHANGELOG as "behavior corrected vs. V1" | ✓ VERIFIED | `domain/resolver.ts` Step 7 (line 420-460): `ComponentPathsSchema` uses `Type.Array(Type.String())` per kind; union accumulator computes declared (entry > manifest) + implicit-by-convention with first-wins dedup. `REQUIREMENTS.md` PR-4 marked `[x] ~~superseded by Phase 5 D-07~~`. `PROJECT.md` D-24 row added. `CHANGELOG.md` line 11: "Behavior corrected vs V1 (COMP-01 / Gap 3)". |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| `orchestrators/plugin/install.ts` | `stateSnapshot.marketplaces[mp].plugins[plugin]` | `withStateGuard` → `loadState` → state.json on disk | Yes -- reads and mutates real state; `saveState` called atomically by guard on success | ✓ FLOWING |
| `orchestrators/plugin/list.ts` | `state.marketplaces` iteration | `loadState(locations.extensionRoot)` per scope | Yes -- reads real state.json per scope; manifest loaded per marketplace | ✓ FLOWING |
| `presentation/plugin-list.ts` | `payload.marketplaces` | Passed from `list.ts` orchestrator | Yes -- orchestrator constructs payload from real state + manifest data | ✓ FLOWING |
| `orchestrators/plugin/update.ts` | `record.version` / `toVersion` | `loadState` + marketplace manifest read | Yes -- reads real state; computes version from resolved manifest entry | ✓ FLOWING |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| All 626 tests pass including PI-1..15, PU-1..8, PUP-1..9, PL-1..7, COMP-01, markers-snapshot, no-orchestrator-network | `npm run check` | `626 pass, 0 fail` | ✓ PASS |
| `updateSinglePlugin` exported as `PluginUpdateFn` type | `grep "export const updateSinglePlugin: PluginUpdateFn"` | Match at update.ts:244 | ✓ PASS |
| `formatRollbackError` has `PathContainmentError` bypass | Read rollback.ts | `instanceof PathContainmentError` check present at lines 42-44 | ✓ PASS |
| RECOVERY_PLUGIN_REINSTALL_PREFIX byte-for-byte value | Read markers.ts | `"plugin-uninstall + plugin-install for"` at line 26 | ✓ PASS |
| PR-4 supersession documented in REQUIREMENTS.md | `grep "superseded by Phase 5 D-07"` | Line 187 matches | ✓ PASS |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| PI-1..15 | 05-06 | Install token parse through concurrent install detection | ✓ SATISFIED | `install.ts` + `tests/orchestrators/plugin/install.test.ts` (626 tests include all PI cases) |
| PU-1..8 | 05-07 | Uninstall ordering through reload hint | ✓ SATISFIED | `uninstall.ts` + `tests/orchestrators/plugin/uninstall.test.ts` |
| PUP-1..9 | 05-09 | Update three forms through cascade/direct routing | ✓ SATISFIED | `update.ts` + `tests/orchestrators/plugin/update.test.ts` |
| PL-1..7 | 05-08 | List filters through autoupdate tag | ✓ SATISFIED | `list.ts` + `presentation/plugin-list.ts` + `tests/orchestrators/plugin/list.test.ts` |
| RN-3 | 05-04 | Cross-plugin conflict guard before any disk write | ✓ SATISFIED | `orchestrators/plugin/shared.ts::assertNoCrossPluginConflicts` |
| AS-2 | 05-06 | Install ordering: skills/prompts → agents → MCP → state commit | ✓ SATISFIED | 5-phase ledger literal array order in install.ts |
| AS-3 | 05-09 | Update is 3-phase: prepare → state-guard swap → physical replace | ✓ SATISFIED | Hand-rolled 3-phase in update.ts (no runPhases) |
| AS-6 | 05-06/07 | Post-commit cleanup leaks surface as warning; state already committed | ✓ SATISFIED | `pluginDataDir mkdir` failure → `notifyWarning` in install.ts; data-dir rm failure → warning in uninstall.ts |
| AS-7 | 05-06 | Orphan agent index entries on rollback surfaces guidance | ✓ SATISFIED | `bridgeWarnings`/`agentForeignFailures` channels in InstallCtx; surfaced via `appendLeaks` |
| NFR-2 | 05-06..09 | No Pi restart required; Run /reload suffices | ✓ SATISFIED | All orchestrators emit `reloadHint` via `presentation/reload-hint.ts` |
| NFR-3 | 05-06..09 | All operations safe to retry (idempotent or fail-clean) | ✓ SATISFIED | `withStateGuard` ensures atomic commit-or-no-change; PU-5 silent converge; PI-15 detection |
| COMP-01 (D-07) | 05-03/10 | Component-path arrays SUPPLEMENT defaults | ✓ SATISFIED | Resolver Step 7 union accumulator; PR-4 superseded in REQUIREMENTS.md; D-24 in PROJECT.md; CHANGELOG entry |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| None found | -- | -- | -- | All orchestrators use `shared/notify.ts` wrappers; no direct `ctx.ui.notify` calls; no `TODO`/`FIXME`/placeholder patterns in Phase 5 source files |

### Human Verification Required

None. All phase-5 truths are mechanically verifiable from source code and test results.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 6 roadmap success criteria are satisfied by codebase evidence:

1. The `installPlugin` function uses a literal 5-phase `Phase<InstallCtx>[]` ledger wrapped in `withStateGuard`, with `formatRollbackError`'s `PathContainmentError` bypass active.
2. `assertNoCrossPluginConflicts` is called before any bridge `prepare*`; `CrossPluginConflictError` lists conflicts deterministically.
3. `updateSinglePlugin: PluginUpdateFn` is exported; the hand-rolled 3-phase swap aggregates phase-3a failures into `PluginUpdatePhase3Error` with the `RECOVERY_PLUGIN_REINSTALL_PREFIX` hint.
4. `uninstallPlugin` reuses `cascadeUnstagePlugin`; PU-5 silent converge is literal silence; PU-8 reload hint is gated on `droppedAny`.
5. `listPlugins` is read-only with PL-1..7 implemented; `renderPluginList` handles icon legend, col-66 truncation, autoupdate tag, and manifest-load warnings.
6. Resolver `ComponentPathsSchema` is `Type.Array(Type.String())` per kind; Step 7 UNION accumulator implements supplement-not-replace; PR-4 superseded in REQUIREMENTS.md + PROJECT.md D-24 + CHANGELOG.

`npm run check`: 626 tests pass, 0 failures.
