# Phase 5 Plan 10: COMP-01 Supersession Documentation Summary

**Three-document supersession trail (REQUIREMENTS.md PR-4 strikethrough + PROJECT.md D-24 Key Decisions row + new CHANGELOG.md with behavior-corrected-vs-V1 entry) closing out D-07 / COMP-01 / Gap 3, with PRD §6.4 PR-4 intentionally retained as historical baseline.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~7 min
- **Started:** 2026-05-11T02:05:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-05-11T02:12:17Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3 (2 modified, 1 created)

## Accomplishments

- REQUIREMENTS.md PR-4 line marked with `~~strikethrough~~` + `[x]` checkbox + supersession note naming Phase 5 D-07 and referencing COMP-01 / Gap 3, mirroring the MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3 supersession style verbatim
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability row for PR-4 updated to `"Superseded by Phase 5 D-07"` (was `Phase 2 | Pending`), matching the format used for MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3
- REQUIREMENTS.md coverage footer updated: 196 mapped (was 197); PR-4 added to the superseded list; Phase 2 per-phase count reduced 39 -> 38
- REQUIREMENTS.md `Last updated` footer refreshed with the COMP-01 supersession note
- PROJECT.md Key Decisions table gained row D-24 (2026-05-10), the next available project-wide decision ID after D-23; cross-references Phase 5 D-07 and 05-CONTEXT.md; documents the resolver `ComponentPathsSchema` migration and bridge `discover.ts` array iteration
- PROJECT.md `Last updated` footer prepended with a new entry documenting the supersession trail
- CHANGELOG.md created at repo root (Keep-a-Changelog 1.1.0 format) with `[Unreleased]` -> `### Changed` -> "Behavior corrected vs V1 (COMP-01 / Gap 3)" entry; cross-references PRD §6.4 PR-4 supersession, PROJECT.md D-24, and 05-CONTEXT.md D-07

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Strikethrough PR-4 in REQUIREMENTS.md with supersession note** - `6f8e780` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add D-24 row to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table** - `b1fa539` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Add CHANGELOG entry for behavior-corrected-vs-V1** - `624411c` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `CHANGELOG.md` - **Created.** Keep-a-Changelog 1.1.0 format. `[Unreleased]` section with `### Changed` subsection containing the COMP-01 / Gap 3 behavior-corrected-vs-V1 entry. Cross-references PRD §6.4 PR-4, PROJECT.md D-24, and 05-CONTEXT.md D-07. (mdformat reformatted the bullet on first commit attempt; second commit landed clean.)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - **Modified.** PR-4 line marked `[x] ~~PR-4~~` with supersession note; traceability row updated to `Superseded by Phase 5 D-07`; coverage footer updated (196 mapped / 4 superseded); Phase 2 per-phase count adjusted 39 -> 38; last-updated footer refreshed.
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - **Modified.** New Key Decisions row D-24 inserted after D-23; mirrors D-21/D-22/D-23 row format (ID, date, bold lead, plain rationale, `-- Locked` outcome). Last-updated footer prepended with supersession-trail entry.

## Decisions Made

- **D-24 allocation strategy:** Used the next available project-wide decision ID (`D-24`) rather than the phase-internal ID (`D-07`), matching the pattern established by D-21 (Phase 1 internal ID for the MA-7 supersession became project-wide D-21) and D-23 (Phase 4 internal D-14 for MU-2/MU-3 became project-wide D-23). The CONTEXT.md explicitly anticipated this (`D-24 in the project-wide decision numbering, distinct from Phase 5 D-07`).
- **Update PR-4 traceability row** (in addition to the per-section strikethrough): MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3 all received corresponding traceability-row updates (`"Superseded by ..."`), so PR-4 should match. The plan didn't explicitly require this but the pattern demands it for consistency. Documented as a minor in-scope enhancement.
- **Update coverage footer and Phase 2 REQ-ID list:** Same rationale -- MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3 are tracked in both the coverage footer ("196 mapped" arithmetic + per-superseded-ID note) and the per-phase REQ-ID list. PR-4 was moved out of Phase 2's list to keep the arithmetic honest (Phase 2 owns 38 mapped REQ-IDs, not 39).
- **CHANGELOG.md created from scratch:** No prior CHANGELOG existed in the repo. The plan anticipated this and provided a Keep-a-Changelog 1.1.0 skeleton. The first commit attempt was reformatted by the repo's `mdformat` pre-commit hook (line-wrapping unwrapped); the second commit landed the mdformat-canonical form.

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written. Three in-scope enhancements beyond the literal text:

1. **Updated PR-4's traceability table row** (line 479) from `Phase 2 | Pending` to `-- | Superseded by Phase 5 D-07`. The plan only specified the per-section strikethrough at line 187, but the MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3 traceability rows were updated when those REQs were superseded, so PR-4 was kept consistent.
2. **Updated REQUIREMENTS.md coverage footer arithmetic** (lines 555-556): "197 mapped" -> "196 mapped"; "Unmapped: 0 (MA-7, MU-2, MU-3 superseded ...)" -> "... + PR-4 superseded ...". Same consistency rationale.
3. **Updated REQUIREMENTS.md Phase 2 per-phase count** (line 563): `39 (..., PR-1..6, ...)` -> `38 (..., PR-1..3, PR-5, PR-6, ...) -- PR-4 superseded by Phase 5 D-07`. Same consistency rationale.

All three changes followed the existing MA-7 / MU-2 / MU-3 precedent verbatim and were captured in the Task 1 commit.

## Issues Encountered

- **Pre-commit hook friction in worktree environment:**
  - TruffleHog hook fails inside Claude Code worktrees because the worktree's `.git` is a file pointing into `.git/worktrees/<id>/`, not a directory. Resolved via the documented `SKIP=trufflehog` opt-out (authorized by orchestrator prompt).
  - First commit attempt for Task 1 used a 79-character commit title (limit is 72). Adjusted to `docs(05-10): strikethrough PR-4 (superseded by Phase 5 D-07)` (53 chars) and re-shortened a body line to satisfy the 80-character body limit.
  - First commit attempt for Task 3 triggered `mdformat` to reformat CHANGELOG.md (unwrapped the bullet's wrapped line). Re-staged and re-committed; second attempt passed cleanly.

## Cross-References (Supersession Trail)

The supersession trail per CONTEXT.md D-07 supersession effect creates 5 independent records of the COMP-01 decision (per threat T-5-20 mitigation):

1. **`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`** PR-4 strikethrough line + traceability table row + coverage footer + Phase 2 per-phase REQ-ID list + last-updated footer
2. **`.planning/PROJECT.md`** Key Decisions row D-24 + last-updated footer
3. **`CHANGELOG.md`** `[Unreleased]` -> `### Changed` entry
4. **`.planning/phases/05-plugin-orchestrators/05-03-SUMMARY.md`** (landed in earlier wave -- the behavior-change commit history)
5. **`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/domain/resolver.ts`** source comments + `tests/domain/resolver-comp01.test.ts` fixture-c assertion (landed in Plan 05-03)

Future regressions to V1 behavior would be detected at test-time by the COMP-01 fixture-c assertion.

## Intentionally Not Modified

- **`docs/prd/pi-claude-marketplace-prd.md` §6.4 PR-4** -- per CONTEXT.md D-07 supersession effect ("PRD §6.4 PR-4 retains the original text as historical baseline; the supersession lives in `.planning/` artifacts only"). A future PRD v2 revision can rewrite §6.4 directly; for V1 the supersession lives in REQUIREMENTS.md, PROJECT.md, and CHANGELOG.md per the D-21 / D-23 pattern. `git diff` confirms no changes to this file in this plan.

## Verification

- `grep "superseded by Phase 5 D-07" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` -> 3 matches (PR-4 line + coverage footer + Phase 2 row)
- `grep "COMP-01" .planning/PROJECT.md` -> 2 matches (D-24 row + last-updated footer)
- `grep "COMP-01|behavior corrected" CHANGELOG.md` -> 1 match (the bullet)
- `git diff 7fb01de..HEAD -- docs/prd/pi-claude-marketplace-prd.md` -> empty (PRD untouched)
- `npm run check` -> green (560 tests pass; typecheck + ESLint + Prettier + tests)

## User Setup Required

None -- this is a documentation-only plan.

## Next Phase Readiness

- COMP-01 supersession trail complete; future readers tracing PR-4's status will find the deliberate change across REQUIREMENTS.md / PROJECT.md / CHANGELOG.md.
- Phase 5 Plan 10 was the last documentation plan in Phase 5's wave 4. With behavior change (Plan 05-03) and documentation supersession (this plan) both landed, COMP-01 is fully resolved.
- No blockers for Phase 6 (edge layer / tab completion) or Phase 7 (integration / Pi wiring). The next PRD revision (V1.1 or V2) can fold D-21 / D-23 / D-24 directly into the PRD text and remove the supersession trail.

## Self-Check: PASSED

**Created files verified:**

- FOUND: `CHANGELOG.md` (1.0K at repo root)
- FOUND: `.planning/phases/05-plugin-orchestrators/05-10-SUMMARY.md` (this file)

**Commits verified:**

- FOUND: `6f8e780` (Task 1 -- `docs(05-10): strikethrough PR-4 (superseded by Phase 5 D-07)`)
- FOUND: `b1fa539` (Task 2 -- `docs(05-10): add D-24 to PROJECT.md (COMP-01 supersedes PR-4)`)
- FOUND: `624411c` (Task 3 -- `docs(05-10): add CHANGELOG.md with COMP-01 behavior-corrected entry`)

**Verification commands all green:**

- REQUIREMENTS.md supersession grep: 3 matches
- PROJECT.md D-24 grep: 2 matches
- CHANGELOG.md COMP-01 grep: 1 match
- PRD §6.4 PR-4 untouched: empty diff
- `npm run check`: exit 0 (560/560 tests pass)
