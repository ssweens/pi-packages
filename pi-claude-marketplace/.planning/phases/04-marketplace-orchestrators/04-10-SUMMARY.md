  - phase: 01-foundations-toolchain
    provides: D-21 / MA-7 supersession precedent (Plan 01-04) -- the exact format mirrored by this plan
provides:
  - REQUIREMENTS.md MU-2 and MU-3 strikethrough + Traceability + Per-phase counts updates recording the D-14 supersession
  - PROJECT.md Key Decisions row D-23 (2026-05-10) capturing the follow-upstream-blindly contract change

# Phase 4 Plan 10: Document D-14 supersession + finalize orchestrators barrel Summary

**Records the user-contract change "follow upstream blindly" (D-14) in REQUIREMENTS.md and PROJECT.md, supersedes PRD MU-2 and MU-3, and finalizes the marketplace orchestrators barrel re-export with all five Phase 4 entry points.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~9 min
- **Started:** 2026-05-10T23:05:00Z (approx)
- **Completed:** 2026-05-10T23:14:49Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- REQUIREMENTS.md MU-2 and MU-3 list items struck through with parenthetical supersession notes pointing at Phase 4 CONTEXT.md D-14
- Traceability table updated: MU-2 and MU-3 now read `-- | Superseded by Phase 4 D-14` (mirrors the MA-7 / D-21 row format established in Plan 01-04)
- Coverage block updated to `Mapped to phases: 197 (98.5%)` with all three superseded REQ-IDs (MA-7, MU-2, MU-3) called out by name
- Per-phase counts row for Phase 4 dropped from 43 to 41 REQ-IDs with the MU-2 / MU-3 supersession parenthetical inline (parallel to the existing MA-7 entry)
- PROJECT.md Key Decisions table gained row **D-23 (2026-05-10)** for the follow-upstream-blindly contract change, marked `-- Locked`
- `orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts` finalized as the public-surface barrel: cross-subcommand helpers from `shared.ts` + the five per-subcommand entry points + 8 option/type re-exports

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (with `SKIP=trufflehog` to satisfy the worktree pre-commit hook constraint):

1. **Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md (MU-2/MU-3 supersession)** -- `51c9c11` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add D-23 row to PROJECT.md Key Decisions** -- `eba786a` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Finalize orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts barrel re-export** -- `0e367f9` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` -- MU-2/MU-3 list items, Traceability table rows, Coverage block, Phase 4 Per-phase counts row
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` -- Key Decisions table gains row D-23 immediately after D-22
- `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts` -- consolidated barrel re-export for the Phase 4 marketplace orchestrators layer

## Exact strings introduced into REQUIREMENTS.md

**MU-2 list item (replaces unchecked single line):**

```
- [x] ~~**MU-2**: GitHub sources `git fetch` then `git pull --ff-only` (symbolic HEAD) or re-checkout stored ref (detached HEAD)~~ (**superseded by Phase 4 D-14**: the local marketplace clone is read-only by contract; `marketplace update` follows upstream blindly via `fetch + forceUpdateRef + checkout` -- see `.planning/phases/04-marketplace-orchestrators/04-CONTEXT.md` D-14. This is a deliberate user-contract change recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions.)
```

**MU-3 list item (replaces unchecked single line):**

```
- [x] ~~**MU-3**: Non-fast-forward divergence surfaces as error; recovery is `marketplace remove` + re-add~~ (**superseded by Phase 4 D-14**: the local clone is never altered, so non-fast-forward divergence cannot exist as a user-visible failure mode; `marketplace update` overwrites the local ref unconditionally -- see `.planning/phases/04-marketplace-orchestrators/04-CONTEXT.md` D-14.)
```

**Traceability table rows (replace `Pending` with `Superseded by Phase 4 D-14`):**

```
| MU-2        | --      | Superseded by Phase 4 D-14 |
| MU-3        | --      | Superseded by Phase 4 D-14 |
```

**Per-phase counts row for Phase 4 (43 -> 41):**

```
| Phase 4: Marketplace Orchestrators            | 41 (MA-1..6, MA-8..11 (MA-7 superseded by D-21), MR-1..8, ML-1..4, MU-1, MU-4..9 (MU-2, MU-3 superseded by Phase 4 D-14), MAU-1..4, SC-5..6, RH-1..5, NFR-5) |
```

## PROJECT.md change

The Key Decisions table gained exactly one new row, dated 2026-05-10, decision **D-23**, immediately after the D-22 row (last in the table prior to this edit). Outcome marker `-- Locked` matches D-21 and D-22 format verbatim. No other PROJECT.md content modified.

`grep -c "D-23 (2026-05-10)" .planning/PROJECT.md` returns 1.

## PRD untouched

`git diff docs/prd/pi-claude-marketplace-prd.md` is empty (0 lines). The PRD is the historical baseline; the D-14 supersession lives in `.planning/` artifacts only, parallel to how Plan 01-04 handled D-21 / MA-7.

## Barrel re-export final shape (extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts)

After Plan 04-10 the barrel exposes:

- **Cross-subcommand helpers (from `shared.ts`):** `DEFAULT_GIT_OPS`, `applyAutoupdateFlip`, `cascadeUnstagePlugin`, `formatErrorWithCauses`, `resolveScopeFromState` plus types `AutoupdateFlipResult`, `GitOps`, `UnstageOutcome`.
- **Per-subcommand entry points:** `addMarketplace` (from `add.ts`), `removeMarketplace` (from `remove.ts`), `listMarketplaces` (from `list.ts`), `updateMarketplace` + `updateAllMarketplaces` (from `update.ts`), `setMarketplaceAutoupdate` (from `autoupdate.ts`).
- **Per-subcommand option types:** `AddMarketplaceOptions`, `RemoveMarketplaceOptions`, `ListMarketplacesOptions`, `UpdateMarketplaceOptions`, `UpdateAllMarketplacesOptions`, `AutoupdateOptions`.

Prettier collapsed the multi-line `export { ... }` blocks into single-line forms during `npm run format:check` -- the resulting file is functionally identical; the consolidation reflects repo-wide Prettier 3.x formatting.

## Decisions Made

None of the orchestrator-layer decisions are new; this plan **records** D-14 in the cross-cutting documents and finalizes the barrel. The follow-upstream-blindly semantic itself was decided by the user during Phase 4 planning (see 04-CONTEXT.md D-14 + 04-DISCUSSION-LOG.md).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

Note on gitlint: the first commit message attempt for Task 2 exceeded the 72-char title limit (77 chars). Per `<task_commit_protocol>` (step "If hook failure, fix and re-commit"), the title was shortened from "record D-23 (Phase 4 D-14 follow-upstream-blindly) in PROJECT.md" to "record D-23 (follow-upstream-blindly) in PROJECT.md" and a new commit created (no `--amend`). The retry passed all hooks. This is a routine hook-failure correction, not a deviation from the plan's content.

## Issues Encountered

None - plan executed exactly as written. `npm run check` exited 0 with 521 tests passing (typecheck + lint + format + tests).

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 4 orchestrators layer is now publicly addressable via a single barrel; Phase 6's edge layer can `import { addMarketplace, removeMarketplace, listMarketplaces, updateMarketplace, updateAllMarketplaces, setMarketplaceAutoupdate } from "../../orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts"`.
- REQUIREMENTS.md and PROJECT.md now reflect the D-14 supersession; downstream phase planners can rely on these artifacts to understand which PRD requirements still bind.
- No blockers for Phase 5 (plugin orchestrators) or Phase 6 (edge layer & tab completion).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` modified -- 4 occurrences of `superseded by Phase 4 D-14` (FOUND).
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` modified -- 1 occurrence of `D-23 (2026-05-10)` (FOUND).
- `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/orchestrators/marketplace/index.ts` modified -- contains `addMarketplace`, `removeMarketplace`, `listMarketplaces`, `updateMarketplace`, `updateAllMarketplaces`, `setMarketplaceAutoupdate`, `DEFAULT_GIT_OPS`, `cascadeUnstagePlugin` (FOUND).
- `git log --oneline` shows three new commits: `51c9c11` (Task 1), `eba786a` (Task 2), `0e367f9` (Task 3) (FOUND).
- `git diff docs/prd/pi-claude-marketplace-prd.md` is empty (PRD UNCHANGED).
- `git diff .planning/STATE.md` is empty; `git diff .planning/ROADMAP.md` is empty (orchestrator-owned files UNCHANGED, as required by worktree-mode contract).
- `npm run check` exits 0 (521 tests pass).
