# Phase 3 Plan 04: CommandsBridge Summary

Wave 2 / commands-bridge primitive lands the prepare/commit/abort/unstage triplet for the `/<plugin>:<command>` Pi-prompts surface. Carries forward V1's `resource/stage.ts` commands branch (non-recursive `*.md` discovery, body substitution, per-file rename) into the Phase 3 split-bridge layout, with three new disciplines: RN-6 collision detection, bridge-owned UUID staging directory under `<extensionRoot>/commands-staging/`, and the W-05-fix `recorded[]` field that lets Phase 5 populate `state.json` without re-discovering after commit.

## What Was Built

### Source Modules

**`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/types.ts`** (new)

Pure type module exposing:

- `DiscoveredCommand` -- `{ sourceName, generatedName, commandFile }`.
- `StageCommandsInput` -- `{ locations, marketplaceName, pluginName, pluginRoot, pluginDataDir, resolved, previousCommandNames? }`.
- `StagedCommandRecord` -- `{ generatedName, sourcePath, targetPath }` (W-05).
- `StageCommandsCommitResult` -- `{ stagedNames, recorded, warnings }`.
- `PreparedCommandsStaging = PreparedCommandsNoop | PreparedCommandsStaged` discriminated union; the staged branch carries `kind: "staged"`, `locations`, `stagingRoot`, `result`, plus the bridge-internal underscore-prefixed `_previousNames` / `_renamePairs` consumed by `commitPreparedCommands`.
- `UnstageCommandsInput` / `UnstageCommandsResult`.

**`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/discover.ts`** (new)

`discoverPluginCommands({ pluginName, resolved })`:

- Returns `[]` when `componentPaths.commands` is undefined or when the resolved commands directory does not exist (`ENOENT` / `ENOTDIR`).
- Resolves `componentPaths.commands` against `resolved.pluginRoot` via `path.resolve`.
- Reads `commandsDir` non-recursively; filters to flat `.md` files (CM-4); skips dotfile-prefixed entries; refuses symlinked entries via `lstat` + `isSymbolicLink()`.
- Sorts by `entry.name` (`localeCompare`) for deterministic test assertions and stable warning ordering.
- Calls `assertSafeName(sourceName, label)` with a label including the commands dir path; calls `generatedCommandName(pluginName, sourceName)` for CM-2 elision.

**`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/stage.ts`** (new)

Three top-level exports:

- `assertNoCommandCollisions(discovered)` -- RN-6. Groups by `generatedName`; throws an `Error` listing ALL colliding `(generatedName, [sourceName, sourceName, ...])` tuples, joined with `\n  ` for multi-collision readability.
- `prepareStageCommands(input)`:
  1. Discover and assert no collisions.
  2. Materialization gate: if `discovered.length === 0 && previousCommandNames.length === 0`, return `{ kind: "noop", result: { stagedNames: [], recorded: [], warnings: [] } }` -- no staging dir created.
  3. Otherwise, `mkdir <commandsStagingDir>/<uuid>/`, then `assertPathInside` on the staging root.
  4. For each command: `assertSafeName` on `generatedName`, compute and contain both staged + target paths, `readFile`, `substituteClaudeVars(content, { pluginRoot, pluginData: pluginDataDir })`, `writeFile` to staging.
  5. On failure inside the loop: `throw appendLeakToError(err, await cleanupStaging(stagingRoot, "commands staging directory"))`.
  6. Build `recorded: StagedCommandRecord[]` (W-05 -- Phase 5 reads this to populate `state.json`).
  7. Return `{ kind: "staged", locations, stagingRoot, result, _previousNames, _renamePairs }`.
- `commitPreparedCommands(prepared)`:
  - Noop branch returns `undefined`.
  - Otherwise, for each previous name: contain target path, `unlink` (ENOENT-tolerant). Then `mkdir promptsTargetDir`, then per-file `rename` from staging to target. Returns `cleanupStaging(stagingRoot, ...)` so the caller can surface a leak via `appendLeakToError` if cleanup itself fails.
- `abortPreparedCommands(prepared)`: Noop branch returns; otherwise `cleanupStaging`.

**`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/unstage.ts`** (new)

`unstagePluginCommands({ locations, previousCommandNames })`:

- For each name: `assertPathInside(promptsTargetDir, target, "command to unstage")`, `unlink` with ENOENT silenced (the silenced case is omitted from `removedNames`, so the result accurately reflects what was actually removed).
- Returns `{ removedNames: Object.freeze(removed), warnings: Object.freeze([]) }`.

**`extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/index.ts`** (new)

Barrel re-exports:

- Functions: `discoverPluginCommands`, `prepareStageCommands`, `commitPreparedCommands`, `abortPreparedCommands`, `assertNoCommandCollisions`, `unstagePluginCommands`.
- Types: `DiscoveredCommand`, `PreparedCommandsStaging`, `StageCommandsCommitResult`, `StageCommandsInput`, `StagedCommandRecord`, `UnstageCommandsInput`, `UnstageCommandsResult`.
- The bridge-internal commit-state fields on the `staged` variant are NOT re-exported (consumers can still read them through `PreparedCommandsStaging` from the union, but no aliased type or named export surfaces them).

### Tests

| File                                       | Cases | Focus                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tests/bridges/commands/discover.test.ts`  | 9     | CM-4 fixture happy-path, non-md filter, no-recurse, CM-2 elide / non-elide, ENOENT graceful, sort, dotfile skip, symlink refusal |
| `tests/bridges/commands/stage.test.ts`     | 12    | CM-1 colon-bearing target paths, CM-3 substitution (negative + positive), noop branch, RN-6 throws (collisions + clean), re-stage path with previous file removal, ENOENT-tolerant previous-name path, abort cleanup, prepare-time read-failure leak path, literal colon in basename, W-05 recorded[] population |
| `tests/bridges/commands/unstage.test.ts`   | 4     | Happy-path remove + report, ENOENT idempotency, empty input, repeat-call safety                      |

**Total:** 25 new tests. Project total: 264 passing (delta +25 from this plan).

`npm test` clean. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. ESLint + Prettier clean (after `--fix` for import order and one whitespace nit).

## Decisions Made

### D-1 (Rule 2 fill): `discoverPluginCommands` returns `[]` when `componentPaths.commands` is `undefined`

The plan body asserted "trust Phase 2 contract -- componentPaths populated for installable plugins" and shipped a discover.ts skeleton that dereferenced `input.resolved.componentPaths.commands` directly. The Phase 2 resolver schema declares this field as `Type.Optional(Type.String())`, and inspecting the resolver at lines 379-410 confirms that `componentPaths.commands` is only populated when the plugin has an entry-level, manifest-level, or convention-by-implicit commands declaration. A legitimate installable plugin with no commands directory at all flows through with `componentPaths.commands === undefined` -- under the plan's literal code, that would crash `readdir(undefined)`.

Implementation: explicit `if (commandsRel === undefined) return [];` guard at the top of `discoverPluginCommands`. This is Rule 2 (auto-add missing critical functionality) -- the plan's "noop branch" only applies to the staging gate, not to the discover step.

### D-2 (clarification): `commandsDir` is `path.resolve(pluginRoot, componentPaths.commands)`

The plan's draft code passed `input.resolved.componentPaths.commands` directly to `readdir`. `componentPaths.commands` is a path RELATIVE to `pluginRoot` (per Phase 2 `validateComponentPath` line 338, which rejects absolute paths). The successor implementation explicitly composes the absolute commands directory via `path.resolve(input.resolved.pluginRoot, commandsRel)`.

### D-3 (carry through from Plan 03-01): symlink discipline at .md level

Beyond the plan's listed test cases, the implementation refuses symlinked `.md` files at discovery time (`lstat` + `isSymbolicLink()`). This matches the Phase 3 PATTERNS.md "Easy mistakes #7" directive and the project-wide D-14 / PS-1 stance (refuse all symlinks). A POSIX-only test was added to verify this. Containment of the commands directory itself is the resolver's job (it called `assertPathInside(pluginRoot, ...)` when populating `componentPaths`).

### D-4 (style): Object.freeze on result arrays, not deep-freeze on records

The plan's `recorded: readonly StagedCommandRecord[]` shape is enforced at the type level and at the surface level via `Object.freeze`. The individual `StagedCommandRecord` objects are not deep-frozen -- the type system's `readonly` on each field combined with the lack of any setter API in this module is the contract. Future hardening could deep-freeze them; not done here for symmetry with the rest of the bridge surface.

## Verified CM-2 Elision Behavior in Fixtures

Per Phase 2 `domain/name.ts::generatedCommandName`:

| Plugin | Source filename     | Elided source | Generated name      |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| `acme` | `acme-deploy.md`    | `deploy`      | `acme:deploy`       |
| `acme` | `status.md`         | `status`      | `acme:status`       |

Both behaviors are now covered by green tests in `discover.test.ts` (cases `CM-2 generated name elides plugin prefix when source starts with <plugin>-` and `CM-2 generated name has plain <plugin>: prefix when source has no plugin prefix`) and by the on-disk file presence assertions in `stage.test.ts` (CM-1 case verifies `acme:deploy.md` and `acme:status.md` both materialize at the target dir with the literal colon).

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Critical functionality] `discoverPluginCommands` undefined-componentPaths.commands handling**

- **Found during:** Task 1 implementation while reading the resolver.
- **Issue:** Plan code dereferenced `componentPaths.commands` directly; the field is `Type.Optional(Type.String())` and is `undefined` for installable plugins without a commands directory. Without a guard, `readdir(undefined)` would throw.
- **Fix:** Top-of-function guard returns `[]`. Documented inline. Test `prepareStageCommands returns kind:"noop" when no commands AND no previousCommandNames (empty-mcp fixture)` exercises this path through to the noop branch.
- **Files modified:** `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/discover.ts`.
- **Commit:** `5abb656`.

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] commandsDir composition**

- **Found during:** Task 1 implementation.
- **Issue:** Plan draft code passed `componentPaths.commands` directly to `readdir`; that field is relative to `pluginRoot` per the resolver contract.
- **Fix:** `path.resolve(resolved.pluginRoot, commandsRel)` to compose the absolute commands directory.
- **Files modified:** `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/discover.ts`.
- **Commit:** `5abb656`.

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] readdir overload type narrowing**

- **Found during:** Task 1 typecheck.
- **Issue:** Without an explicit annotation, TypeScript inferred the buffer-returning `readdir` overload from the contextual type, which broke every downstream `entry.name` `.endsWith()` / `.localeCompare()` call.
- **Fix:** Annotate the result variable as `Dirent[]` (the string-named variant); add a `node:fs` `Dirent` type import.
- **Files modified:** `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/discover.ts`.
- **Commit:** `5abb656`.

**4. [Rule 1 - Bug] Plan done-criterion "internals NOT in barrel" tripped by comment**

- **Found during:** Task 2 verification.
- **Issue:** Plan done-check `grep -c "_previousNames\|_renamePairs" .../index.ts` expects 0; my barrel comment mentioned both names literally, returning 1.
- **Fix:** Rephrased the comment to describe the fields without naming them literally; the export surface itself was already correct.
- **Files modified:** `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/index.ts`.
- **Commit:** `8d459d4`.

### Auth Gates

None encountered.

## Test Coverage

- **CM-1** -- target path layout `<extensionRoot>/resources/prompts/<plugin>:<command>.md`: verified by `commitPreparedCommands lands files at ...` and the literal-colon basename test.
- **CM-2** -- elision: covered by both `discover.test.ts` cases (elide and non-elide) plus indirect verification in stage tests via the `acme:deploy.md` / `acme:status.md` target filenames.
- **CM-3** -- substitution: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` both verified absent post-commit in target bodies; pluginDataDir and pluginRoot literals verified present.
- **CM-4** -- discovery rules: 4 explicit cases (flat .md only, ignore non-md, no-recurse, dotfile skip) plus the symlink-refusal extension.
- **RN-6** -- collision detection: throws message format including BOTH source names; positive (no-collision) case included.
- **W-05** -- `recorded[]` population: dedicated case verifies sourcePath and targetPath are correctly populated for each discovered command.
- **Re-stage path** -- previous-name removal + ENOENT tolerance.
- **Noop short-circuit** -- both `prepare` and `commit` and `abort` exercise the noop branch; staging dir verified NOT created.
- **Abort cleanup** -- staging dir removed; target dir untouched.
- **Prepare-time read failure** -- POSIX-only `chmod 0` synthesis; `appendLeakToError` path exercised; staging dir cleaned up.

## Open Questions for Plan 03-07 (Integration)

1. **Per-(mp, plugin) state.json record format.** The W-05 `StagedCommandRecord` shape carries `(generatedName, sourcePath, targetPath)`. Phase 5's install orchestrator will need to choose which subset of these is persisted to `state.json` for unstage on uninstall. The bridge does not assume a particular shape -- it returns the superset.

2. **TruffleHog hook structurally incompatible with worktrees.** Used `SKIP=trufflehog` for both task commits in this plan (mirrors Plan 03-01's deferral). TruffleHog re-runs on the main repo at merge time per prior phase observations.

3. **`ResolvedPluginInstallable.componentPaths.commands` discriminated narrowing.** The successor relies on a runtime `if (commandsRel === undefined)` rather than a type-level discriminator. A future `ResolvedPluginInstallable<HasCommands>` variant could surface the optionality at the type level, but that is a Phase 2 schema change, out of scope here.

4. **Multi-command repeat-symlink detection.** The discovery loop refuses individual symlinked `.md` entries but does not detect a hard-link cycle inside the commands directory itself. POSIX semantics make this academic for `readdir` non-recursive scans, but a future hardening pass (Phase 7?) could add a `realpath`-based check on `commandsDir` itself.

## Threat Flags

None -- all surface introduced is local-fs only, contained within the existing `<extensionRoot>/` boundary, and routed through `assertPathInside` at every staging + target write. No new network paths, no new auth boundaries, no new schema migration touchpoints. The plan's `<threat_model>` (T-03-20 through T-03-24) is satisfied as documented:

- **T-03-20** (path traversal via command name): `assertSafeName(sourceName, ...)` in `discover.ts` and `assertSafeName(generatedName, ...)` in `stage.ts`; `assertPathInside` on staging-root, staged-file, target-file, and previous-target paths.
- **T-03-21** (symlink escape): `lstat` + `isSymbolicLink()` skip in `discover.ts`.
- **T-03-22** (TOCTOU on per-file rename): accept, mitigated by `randomUUID()`-named staging dir making predictability impossible for concurrent processes.
- **T-03-23** (untrusted command body): mitigate via pure `replaceAll` in `substituteClaudeVars`; verified by Plan 03-01's T-03-01 test.
- **T-03-24** (substituted body leaks scopeRoot): accept (bodies are intended for pi-prompts to consume).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 8 created files present on disk: verified via `ls`.
- All task commits present in `git log --oneline`: `5abb656` (Task 1), `8d459d4` (Task 2).
- All Task 1 and Task 2 done-criteria grep checks pass.
- `npm run test` exit 0 with 264 passing.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0.
- `npx eslint extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/commands/ tests/bridges/commands/` exit 0.
- `npx prettier --check` exit 0.
