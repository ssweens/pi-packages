// Quick 260516-02r: one-keystroke onboarding for the Anthropic marketplace.
//
// Composes the two already-idempotent orchestrators
// (`addMarketplace` + `setMarketplaceAutoupdate`) under hard-coded
// user scope so a new Pi user can run `/claude:plugin bootstrap` and
// land in a working state with the canonical Anthropic marketplace
// configured and tracking upstream.
//
// Notes / forbidden patterns (reviewer guard rails):
//   - No direct `ctx.ui.notify` here. All user-visible signals come
//     from the two composed orchestrators via shared/notify.ts (BLOCK A).
//   - No `notifySuccess` wrapper added on top of the composed
//     orchestrators -- the contract is one user-visible signal per
//     state change; the composed orchestrators each emit exactly that.
//   - No `gitOps` default applied here -- `addMarketplace` already
//     applies `DEFAULT_GIT_OPS` when `opts.gitOps` is undefined.
//   - No `scope` field on `BootstrapOptions` -- scope is hard-coded to
//     `"user"`. The edge handler also rejects `--scope` explicitly.
//   - No pre-check of `loadState` to skip steps; the underlying
//     orchestrators are already idempotent under `withStateGuard`, and
//     pre-checking would introduce a TOCTOU race with concurrent install
//     locks plus duplicate logic.
//   - Only `MarketplaceDuplicateNameError` is swallowed from
//     `addMarketplace`. All other errors propagate so the surface
//     matches existing orchestrator behavior.

 * Add the canonical Anthropic marketplace to user scope and enable

 *   - first run on clean state: emits two notifications (add + enable).
 *   - re-run on fully bootstrapped state: emits ONE idempotent
 *     "Already enabled: ..." notification from the autoupdate step.
 *     The add step's `MarketplaceDuplicateNameError` is swallowed so
 *     no duplicate "already added" message is emitted.
 *   - re-run on half-bootstrapped state (marketplace present, autoupdate
 *     off): emits ONE "Enabled autoupdate: ..." notification.
 *
 * Inherited GitHub-source clone-before-name-check trade-off (WR-05 in
 * `orchestrators/marketplace/add.ts`): for github sources, the
 * `MarketplaceDuplicateNameError` is raised AFTER the clone fills a
 * staging dir, because the marketplace name lives inside the cloned
 * manifest. The bootstrap's idempotent re-run therefore performs one
 * clone-and-cleanup before swallowing the duplicate-name error. NFR-5
 * is unaffected because NFR-5 governs path-source / read-only commands
 * (`install`, `list`, `uninstall`, `marketplace remove`, path-source
 * `marketplace add`); the bootstrap inherits the same surface as the
 * underlying github-source `marketplace add`. Avoiding the clone would
 * require a pre-`loadState` lookup against user-scope state, which is
 * the explicit TOCTOU anti-pattern this orchestrator opts out of.
