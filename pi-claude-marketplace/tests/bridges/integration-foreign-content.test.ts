// tests/bridges/integration-foreign-content.test.ts
//
// Phase 3 capstone -- foreign-content preservation + CommitResult.failed[]
// surfacing across the agents bridge end-to-end.
//
// Verifies ROADMAP success criterion 2: AG-5 foreign content (a previously-
// indexed target file whose body has lost the verbatim marker, OR whose
// basename no longer matches `pi-claude-marketplace-*`) is preserved BYTE-
// IDENTICAL on commit and surfaced via the bridge's `result.failed[]` array
// (D-06 corollary: prepare-time foreign content does NOT throw, it surfaces
// softly so the install can still proceed for the agents that ARE owned).
//
// Detection model (matches stage.ts step 7): foreign content is detected by
// walking each `previousEntries` row from the agents-index and stat'ing its
// `targetPath`. A pre-seeded foreign file WITHOUT a corresponding index row
// is undetectable to the bridge -- which is correct, because such a file
// wasn't ours to track in the first place. The test therefore pre-seeds an
// agents-index entry pointing at the fixture-supplied foreign content.
