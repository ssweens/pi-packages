// tests/bridges/integration.test.ts
//
// Phase 3 capstone -- multi-bridge happy-path end-to-end test.
//
// Exercises all four bridges (skills, commands, agents, MCP) in sequence
// against the full-plugin fixture from Plan 03-01. Verifies ROADMAP success
// criterion 1: every supported artefact lands at its PRD-specified path with
// the correct generated name and ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} / ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
// substituted in bodies. Also exercises idempotency (re-stage produces the
// same on-disk state).
//
// Per D-01 each bridge's PreparedXxx handle is a distinct discriminated union;
// composition is exercised here only by calling each bridge's prepare/commit
// pair in turn, NOT by passing one bridge's prepared handle to another.
//
// REQ-IDs covered (assertion messages reference each ID for grep traceability):
//   SK-1, SK-2, SK-3, SK-4
//   CM-1, CM-2, CM-3
//   AG-1, AG-2, AG-3, AG-5
//   MC-5, MC-6
//   AS-8, AS-9 (cross-bridge symmetry; full noop end-to-end coverage in
//               integration-materialization-gate.test.ts)
