// Deliberate import-x boundary violation. The canary test in
// `tests/architecture/import-boundaries.test.ts` runs the programmatic
// ESLint API against THIS file and asserts:
//   (a) at least one message has ruleId === "import-x/no-restricted-paths"
//   (b) ZERO messages have ruleId === "import-x/no-unresolved" (so we know
//       the rule fired for the boundary, not for a missing file)
//
// This file is excluded from CI's normal eslint run via the
// `ignores: ["tests/fixtures/bad-imports/**"]` block in eslint.config.js
// (added in Plan 01). The canary test passes `ignore: false` to override.
//
// The import target `extensions/pi-claude-marketplace/bridges/index.ts` is a
// placeholder shipped by Plan 03 (`export {};`). It exists -- the fixture
// is NOT failing because of a missing file; it's failing because edge/ may
// not import from bridges/ per D-11.
