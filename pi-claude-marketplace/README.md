## Features

Installs plugins from the Claude plugin marketplace that contain these components:

- Commands.
- Skills.
- Agents. Requires [pi-subagents](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-subagents).
- MCP servers. Requires [pi-mcp-adapter](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-mcp-adapter).

Plugins that contain unsupported components are marked as "unavailable".

## Prerequisites

- [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev)
- [pi-subagents](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-subagents) (optional but recommended, `pi install npm:pi-subagents`)
- [pi-mcp-adapter](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-mcp-adapter) (optional but recommended, `pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter`)

## Usage

Install the Pi extension.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-claude-marketplace
```

Bootstrap the offical Claude plugin marketplace (`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`).

```text
/claude:plugin bootstrap
```

List plugins available for installation.

```text
/claude:plugin list --available
```

Install a plugin.

```text
/claude:plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official
```

Add another marketplace.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add upstash/context7
```

List its plugins.

```text
/claude:plugin list context7-marketplace --available
```

Add another plugin.

```text
/claude:plugin context7-plugin@context7-marketplace
```

Then reload.

```text
/reload
```

### Name mapping

Command and skill names are prefixed with the plugin name. If the command or skill is already prefixed with the plugin name plus `-`, that common part is elided.

Commands and skill names use Pi's colon form:

| Plugin name | Command or skill name | Pi name    |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| `foo`       | `bar`                 | `/foo:bar` |
| `foo`       | `foo-bar`             | `/foo:bar` |
| `foo`       | `foo`                 | `/foo:foo` |

Skills additionally use hyphenated generated names after the `/skill:` prefix:

| Plugin name | Skill name | Pi name          |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| `foo`       | `bar`      | `/skill:foo-bar` |
| `foo`       | `foo-bar`  | `/skill:foo-bar` |
| `foo`       | `foo`      | `/skill:foo`     |

MCP server names are not prefixed or rewritten. The server name is the key from the plugin's `mcpServers` object. If another MCP config already uses that name, the plugin install or update fails.

| Plugin name | `mcpServers` key | Pi MCP server name               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `foo`       | `api`            | `api`                            |
| `foo`       | `foo-api`        | `foo-api`                        |
| `bar`       | `api`            | conflict if `api` already exists |

### Scoping

Marketplaces and plugins can be installed in the user scope or in the current project's scope. The default is user scope.

The user scope is inherited, so it is possible to install a plugin from a user-scope marketplace in the project scope.

It is also possible to install the same plugin in both user and project scopes; the plugin in the user scope takes precedence.

## `/claude:plugin` reference

This extension mirrors Claude Code's `/plugin` command. Use `/claude:plugin` in Pi for marketplace and plugin operations, then run `/reload` after installing, uninstalling, updating, or reinstalling plugins so Pi discovers the changed resources.

### Marketplace

Add a marketplace from a GitHub repository `owner/repo` shorthand.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add upstash/context7
```

Add the same marketplace from a GitHub URL.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add https://github.com/upstash/context7-marketplace
```

Add a marketplace from a GitHub SSH URL, including private repositories your SSH agent can access.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add git@github.com:upstash/context7-marketplace.git
/claude:plugin marketplace add ssh://git@github.com/upstash/context7-marketplace.git
```

Pin a GitHub marketplace to a branch, tag, or commit with a `#ref` suffix.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add https://github.com/upstash/context7-marketplace#v1.0.30
/claude:plugin marketplace add git@github.com:upstash/context7-marketplace.git#v1.0.30
```

Add a marketplace from the local filesystem. The path may be a directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or a direct path to a `marketplace.json` file.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add ~/my-marketplace
/claude:plugin marketplace add ~/my-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

Add a marketplace local to the current project with `--scope project`. The default scope is `user`.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add upstash/context7-marketplace --scope project
```

List configured marketplaces.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace list
/claude:plugin marketplace ls
```

Update one marketplace, or all marketplaces if a name is omitted.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace update context7-marketplace
/claude:plugin marketplace update
```

Remove a marketplace and all plugins installed from it.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace remove context7-marketplace
/claude:plugin marketplace rm context7-marketplace
```

Toggle marketplace plugin auto-updates. When the marketplace is updated manually, installed plugins are automatically updated.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace autoupdate context7-marketplace
/claude:plugin marketplace noautoupdate context7-marketplace
```

### Plugin

List plugins available for installation. Omit the marketplace name to list across configured marketplaces.

```text
/claude:plugin list context7-marketplace --available
/claude:plugin list --available
```

Filter the list by plugin status, installed, available for installation, or unavailable to install.

```text
/claude:plugin list --installed
/claude:plugin list --available
/claude:plugin list --unavailable
```

Install a plugin, using the `<plugin>@<marketplace>` format.

```text
/claude:plugin install context7-plugin@context7-marketplace
```

Install in the project scope instead of the user scope.

```text
/claude:plugin install context7-plugin@context7-marketplace --scope project
```

Update one installed plugin, every installed plugin from one marketplace, or all installed plugins.

```text
/claude:plugin update context7-plugin@context7-marketplace
/claude:plugin update @context7-marketplace
/claude:plugin update
```

Reinstall one installed plugin, every installed plugin from one marketplace, or all installed plugins. Reinstall uses the cached marketplace manifest and the installed record's existing version; it does not fetch, pull, or otherwise sync the marketplace from the network:

```text
/claude:plugin reinstall pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official
/claude:plugin reinstall @claude-plugins-official
/claude:plugin reinstall
```

Limit reinstall to one scope with `--scope user` or `--scope project`. The flag can appear before or after the target:

```text
/claude:plugin reinstall --scope project
/claude:plugin reinstall @claude-plugins-official --scope user
```

The `--scope` flag selects which installed plugin records and generated resources are reinstalled; the marketplace reference identifies the source marketplace. For an explicit plugin target, reinstall reports `not installed` in the selected scope instead of failing just because that marketplace is configured in another scope.

Use `--force` only when reinstalling a plugin whose own previous agent files were manually edited or otherwise look foreign. `--force` can overwrite that plugin's previous agent content, but it does not override other-plugin ownership conflicts, unsafe names, path-containment failures, or MCP server name collisions:

```text
/claude:plugin reinstall pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official --force
```

Reinstall targets installed plugins only. If no installed plugins match the selected target set, the command reports `No plugins installed.` and does not emit a reload hint. Plugin data directories are deleted only after replacement resources and `state.json` commit successfully; if reinstall fails, the previous plugin state, resources, and data remain available.

> [!NOTE]
> Agent definitions in plugins may include a preferred model for running the agent, e.g. "sonnet", "opus", etc. These are discarded by default, but the `--map-model` option for `install` can be used to make a best-effort attempt at mapping these models to Pi models.

Uninstall a plugin.

```text
/claude:plugin uninstall context7-plugin@context7-marketplace
```

Reload Pi after changes.

```text
/reload
```

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a convenience one-shot setup of the official Anthropic marketplace in the user scope with autoupdate enabled.

```text
/claude:plugin bootstrap
```

This is equivalent to running.

```text
/claude:plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-marketplace
/claude:plugin marketplace autoupdate anthropics/claude-plugins-marketplace
```

### Import

Import is a convenience command to import marketplaces and plugins already defined in Claude Code settings.

```text
/claude:plugin import
```

By default, marketplaces and plugins are added in accordance to the scope that they're defined in Claude Code. It's also possible to limit the import to a specific scope.

```text
/claude:plugin import --scope user
/claude:plugin import --scope project
```

Plugins that are not available for installation in Pi because of unsupported components are skipped with a warning.

## Development

Install pre-commit hooks.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Enable Git LFS for large binary assets such as images and videos.

```bash
git lfs install
```

Build.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
```
