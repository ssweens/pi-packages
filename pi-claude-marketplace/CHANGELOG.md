# Changelog

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-16

- Added `/claude:plugin reinstall` command: re-stages an installed plugin from its cached marketplace manifest without touching the network or changing the recorded version. Supports `reinstall <plugin>@<marketplace>`, `reinstall @<marketplace>`, bare `reinstall`, `--scope user|project`, and `--force` for plugins whose previous agent files were manually edited. Failure preserves the previous installed plugin, resources, and data directory; the plugin data directory is cleaned up only after the replacement and state commit succeed.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-16

- Added convenience `import` command to install marketplaces and plugins defined in the Claude Code configuration.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-16

- Added `/claude:plugin bootstrap` command: one-shot setup of the official Anthropic marketplace (`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`) in user scope with autoupdate enabled. Idempotent -- safe to re-run.
- Model specifications in plugin agent manifests are ignored unless the `--map-models` option is used when installing or updatinga plugin.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-15

- Clearer marketplace/plugin scoping rules.
- Completion on `/claude:plugin install` is limited to available plugins.
